# Codechallenge
Code challenge project
The project was about creating a repository on github to handle 3 different challenges.
I handled them via javascript

THE FIRST CHALLENGE:
Student grade generator:
I used the functions to help output the students grades
The input was between 0-100 and it was ro output grades from A to E

THE SECOND CHALLENGE:
Speed detector:
I used the functions to tak th speed of the car
The speed was to b less than 70 for the ouput to be OK and anything more than that would print a demerit point for the driver 

THE THIRD CHALLENGE:
Net Salary Calculator:
I wote program whose major task was to calculate an individualâ€™s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits.
This would then calculate the payee, NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary.
